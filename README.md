# Simple RNN (Python)
A port of the [Simple_RNN project](https://github.com/setu4993/Simple_RNN) (originally in C++) to Python.

My paper ['A water demand prediction model for Central Indiana'](https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16511) describing the original project was published as a part of the Thirtieth Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI '18).
